# U-Turn-Accident-Prevention-System
The project aims to enhance safety at intersections by preventing accidents during U-turn maneuvers. This will be achieved by integrating IoT-enabled ultrasonic sensors and traffic lights. The system detects nearby vehicles and adjusts traffic signals to manage traffic flow, thereby reducing the risk of collisions.

# Scope
The project involves the design, development, and deployment of an IoT system that uses ultrasonic sensors to monitor the proximity of vehicles making U-turns. It will control traffic lights in real-time based on the detected distances, ensuring safe U-turn maneuvers.

# Components
# 1.Ultrasonic Sensors:

-High-Precision Sensors: To detect the distance of approaching vehicles.
-Weather-Resistant Enclosures: To ensure reliable operation in various environmental conditions.
# 2.Traffic Lights (LEDs):
Red and Green LEDs: To control traffic based on sensor data.

# 3. Microcontroller:
Arduino UNO or Similar: To process sensor data and control traffic lights.

# Expected Outcomes
-Significant reduction in U-turn-related accidents.
-Enhanced driver awareness and reaction time during U-turn maneuvers.
-Improved overall traffic safety at intersections.
