# U-Turn-Accident-Prevention-System
The project aims to enhance safety at intersections by preventing accidents during U-turn maneuvers. This will be achieved by integrating IoT-enabled ultrasonic sensors and traffic lights. The system detects nearby vehicles and adjusts traffic signals to manage traffic flow, thereby reducing the risk of collisions.
